            It's as if all the colors of the spectrum were shining, not at the same time, but \
            just fast enough that they constantly scramble.\
            You can't make out the position of the object in space. It seems to float, \
            but then it doesn't. Your friend Sam remarks 'It's \
            as if I'm looking at an object that didn't need a perspective. \
            Or as if that object's perspective didn't need us.\
            ' Ursula adds 'It looks shallow. It's out of focus. \
            As if we were all in a picture \
            and that thing was out of range.");
