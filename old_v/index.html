    <div id="child1"><p id="first">Alma wakes up suddenly, eyes wide open, then slowly closes them and rests her head on the pillow, still, for a few more seconds. She draws a long, generous yet tired breath, and tells herself: "Only an arm or a leg has to move out of bed. Don't worry, the rest will follow."<br>
        And that's what she does. She pulls a forearm away from the beds' gravity pull. Slowly, the rest of her body follows her arm. Her head tilts as she gathers muscles to support her sitting up. Her horizon shifts.<br>
        Then she speaks, out loud: "Hello, Tuesday June 4 2019."<br>
        
        <!-- It's a clear, bright day, around 6:00pm.
                                         You are walking towards your neighborhood park with your friends Sam,
                                         Ursula and Leeloo. Ursula brought her favorite bottle of red wine: a grenache blend from Spain smelling of
                                         ripe fruit and what she describes as "purple".
                                         (Ursula has a serious case of synesthesia, especially when it comes to perceptions
                                        of wine.)-->
