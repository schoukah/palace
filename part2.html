        When she was 17, Alma learned that the current year in the Muslim calendar was 1426 AH. She got curious, and started following other calendars: Hebrew, Greek Orthodox, Buddhist, Hindu. By the time she was 20, Alma got so mixed up that she decided to stick to the Gregorian. But to highlight its uniqueness --to cultivate awareness that regardless of the calendar, a day is a day that won't come back, ever-- she started saluting the date and the year as as the first thing she did right after waking up.
        <!-- Alma wakes up this way every morning. She gathers body parts and pulls them out of bed.
             And she salutes the day, every day. She gives her hellos knowing that there's no further time or space what she's going through can be or feel more real. And everyday is unique. She salutes that uniqueness. She bows to her own unique point in the never-re-occuring present.  -->
